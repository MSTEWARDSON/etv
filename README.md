web service for local control of my home server

In a sense, this is my home server dashboard.

## web services

The web services control the ISC BIND DNS Server by editing the named.conf.local file 
from a standard ubuntu/debian config. This allowed me to block or unblock various sites.
It also blocks some network hosts using iptables.

## UI

The UI is a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS. The JS is vanilla and simple.
